    <h1>Rickster's CV</h1>

    <p>The wonderful thing about <strong><i>Ricksters</i></strong> is <strong><i>Ricksters</i></strong> are wonderful things.<br>
    Their brains are made out of flubber, they love to eat chicken wings. <br>
    Their bouncey, trouncey, flouncey, pouncey, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun. <br>
    But the most wonderful thing about <strong><i>Ricksters</i></strong> is I'm the only one. <br>
